# Rock Paper Scissors

## Self-learn project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)

### Description

A simple javascript rock-paper-scissors game, made from scratch to put what I've learned from the odin project into practice!

### How does it work?

For now, the game is only played through the browser console.
Later on it will be updated to be fleshed out with a Graphical User Interface, buttons text etc.
